# 2_Image_Segmentation_using_U-net_Architecture

Ronneberger et al., 2015 presented U-net architecture (Fig. 1) to segment biomedical images [1].However, other than this specific application, U-net architecture has been found to be very useful for much broader computer vision application for semantic segmentation [2].
